        - 1.00 was too stupid! Now you can check your password against
	  an arbitrary amount of user's data. This imposed a change in
	  module's interface and, therefore, documentation.
	  A part about the difference between Data::Password and
	  Data::Password::BasicCheck was missing, hopefully this has
  	  been fixed

        - updated the documentation for publication on CPAN,
          a great thank to dree (Andrea Maestrutti) for his
          help.
