Revision history for Perl extension Data::Password::BasicCheck.

2.03  Tue Apr 23 11:19:46 CEST 2013
        - fixing bug 84736: spelling error in documentation

2.02  Sat Feb  2 15:09:20 CET 2013
        - fixing bug 83036: BasicCheck.pm returns incorrect error code
	  when there are not enough different symbols.
	  See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83036 for details
	  So strange to get a bug report nearly 9 years after the last
	  release of the module!!!

2.01  Released on March 8, 2004
        - fixed some oddities in new()

        - 1.00 was too stupid! Now you can check your password against
	  an arbitrary amount of user's data. This imposed a change in
	  module's interface and, therefore, documentation.
	  A part about the difference between Data::Password and
	  Data::Password::BasicCheck was missing, hopefully this has
  	  been fixed

          help.
