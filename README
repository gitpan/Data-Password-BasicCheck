Data/Password/BasicCheck version 2.00
=====================================

    Data::Password::BasicChecker objects do these kind of checks on the
    given passwords:

    *   password length is in a defined range that is estabilished at
        object creation;

    *   there are at least pL symbols in password, where L is password
        length and p is 0 < p =< 1. If not specified at object creation
        we assume p = 2/3 (that is: 0.66666...)

    *   password contains alphabetic characters, digits and
        non-alphanumeric characters;

    *   rotations of the password don't match it (e.g.: the password
        a1&a1& matches itself after three rotations)

    *   after cleaning away digits and symbols, the password, its
        reverse and all possible rotations don't match any personal
        information given (name, surname, city, username)
